# Personality-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-LR with SGD-RF-and-XGBoost-in-Java-Tribuo
A Java-based Personality Detection System using the Tribuo ML framework. Trains and compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to predict personality traits from behavioral data, deploying the best-performing model for accurate predictions.

üì¶ Resources Used
------------------

Java: Version 17 was used to develop and run the project, leveraging modern Java features and long-term support stability.

IDE / Platform: The project is developed using Eclipse IDE, a popular Java development environment that integrates well with Maven and provides powerful debugging and editing features.

Tribuo: Oracle‚Äôs open-source machine learning library for Java, compatible with Java 8+, used for loading datasets, model building, evaluation, and serialization.

üìä Dataset
-----------

Source: [Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshkapilavai/extrovert-vs-introvert-behavior-data)

Description:
The dataset contains behavioral and social variables, such as:

Time_spent_Alone (numeric)

Stage_fear (categorical: Yes/No)

Social_event_attendance (numeric)

Going_outside (numeric)

Drained_after_socializing (categorical: Yes/No)

Friends_circle_size (numeric)

Post_frequency (numeric)

Class variable: Personality with values INTROVERT or EXTROVERT (target for classification)

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training Algorithms
-----------------------

Logistic Regression:
Binary classification using a linear model trained via stochastic gradient descent.

Random Forest:
An ensemble of decision trees trained with bagging and fully weighted voting, offering robust, high-accuracy predictions.

XGBoost:
Gradient boosted trees optimized through hyperparameter tuning (rounds, max depth, learning rate).

üöÄ Results and Application
---------------------------

The Random Forest model was selected as the best model with highest accuracy (~92.5%).

This trained Random Forest model was saved, loaded, and used to build a real-time personality detection system that predicts personality from new input feature values.
